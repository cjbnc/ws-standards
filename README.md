NC State Services Interoperability Group
========================================

The idea behind the group is for project representatives to talk about the commonalities between
our projects and find ways we can work together. If other folks want to adopt what weâ€™re doing
they are welcome to do so, but that is not the aim.

Proposing a Standards Recommendation
------------------------------------

To propose a web services standards recommendation (WSSR):

- fork this repo, create a branch, checkout that branch, add the WSSR in
  `proposed/`, push the branch to Github, and send a pull request.
